/**
 * This module implements a soft-body physics-based version of the classic Breakout game 
 * using JavaFX. The implementation is based on a hybrid design pattern that combines 
 * Entity-Component-System (ECS) with Model-View-Controller (MVC) principles. 
 * 
 * <p>
 *  The game features a soft-body simulation where bricks and the ball exhibit 
 *  elastic, deformable behaviour upon collision. This adds a layer of realism 
 *  and complexity to the traditional Breakout gameplay.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Entity-Component-System (ECS):</b> Used to handle game entities, 
 *   their components, and systems that process game logic.</li>
 *   <li><b>Model-View-Controller (MVC):</b> Provides a structured approach 
 *   to separate the game's logic (model), user interface (view), and control 
 *   logic (controller).</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h2>Features</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Soft-body physics simulation for dynamic, deformable interactions.</li>
 *   <li>JavaFX for rendering and user interface management.</li>
 *   <li>Hybrid ECS-MVC architecture for clean, maintainable, and scalable code.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h2>Dependencies</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>JavaFX: For graphics and UI components.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
  * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>
 *  This module is designed to function as a stand-alone application. However, 
 *  the codebase is open-source and deliberately crafted with extensibility in mind, 
 *  allowing developers to modify or extend the functionality to suit their needs. 
 *  Itâ€™s important to note that while the codebase is thoroughly documented, 
 *  there is no singular minimal API explicitly designed for extension. As such, 
 *  the more extensive the modifications desired, the more familiarisation with 
 *  the underlying codebase will be required. Developers intending to make significant 
 *  changes should be prepared to delve into the existing architecture to fully understand 
 *  its components and interactions.
 * </p>

 * 
 * <h2>Possible Future Enhancements</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Additional power-ups and brick types with unique behaviours.</li>
 *   <li>Expanded soft-body physics effects for more realistic simulations.</li>
 * </ul>
