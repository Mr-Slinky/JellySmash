/**
 * Models a physical spring, connecting two <code>PointMass</code> objects in a
 * physics simulation. It simulates behaviour following Hooke's Law, where the
 * force exerted by the spring is proportional to the displacement from its rest
 * length. The class supports methods to calculate spring forces, potential
 * energy, and dynamic updates to the rest length, simulating realistic spring
 * behaviour.
 * 
 * <br><b>Key Concepts</b>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Hooke's Law:</b> The force exerted by the spring is defined by:
 * <pre> F = -k * (x - L_0) </pre> where <code>k</code> is the spring constant,
 * <code>x</code> is the current length of the spring, and <code>L_0</code> is
 * the rest length.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Rest Length:</b> The length at which the spring is neither stretched
 * nor compressed. The spring will try to return to this length by applying a
 * force on the connected <code>PointMass</code> objects.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Spring Constant:</b> Also referred to as stiffness, the spring
 * constant <code>k</code> defines the stiffness of the spring. A higher value
 * results in a stiffer spring that applies more force for the same
 * displacement.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <br><b>Usage</b>
 * <p>
 * To create a <code>Spring</code> object between two <code>PointMass</code>
 * objects, use the static factory methods:
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 *     PointMass p1 = new PointMass(...);
 *     PointMass p2 = new PointMass(...);
 *     Spring spring = Spring.between(p1, p2, 0.8);   // With custom  <b>spring constant</b>
 *     Spring defaultSpring = Spring.between(p1, p2); // Uses default <b>spring constant</b>
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * Once instantiated, the spring can be used to calculate forces, energy, or to
 * update its state dynamically.
 * </p>
 *
 * <br><b>Important Methods</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b><code>force</code>:</b> Calculates the force exerted by the spring based on the
 * displacement from the rest length. This force will pull the
 * <code>PointMass</code> objects towards or push them away from each other.
 * </li>
 * <li><b><code>relax</code>:</b> Dynamically sets the rest length of the spring to its
 * current length, effectively neutralising the force it exerts at that moment.
 * Useful for adapting the spring during runtime.
 * </li>
 * <li><b><code>potentialEnergy</code>:</b> Calculates the potential energy stored in the
 * spring based on its current stretch or compression. This energy is
 * proportional to the square of the displacement.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <br><b>Example</b>
 * <p>
 * This class can be integrated into a physics simulation system, where
 * <code>Spring</code> objects apply forces on their connected points. For
 * instance:
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 *     PointMass p1  = new PointMass(Vector2D.zero(),     Vector2D.zero(), 10, 0.5, 1, false);
 *     PointMass p2  = new PointMass(Vector2D.of(10, 10), Vector2D.zero(), 10, 0.5, 1, false);
 *     Spring spring = Spring.between(p1, p2, 0.8);
 *
 *     Vector2D force = spring.force();          // Calculate the spring force
 *     double energy = spring.potentialEnergy(); // Get potential energy of the spring
 *     spring.relax();                           // Update rest length to current displacement
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <br><b>Fluid API Methods</b>
 * <p>
 * The <code>Spring</code> class incorporates a fluid API design, where several 
 * methods return the <code>Spring</code> object itself, allowing method calls 
 * to be chained together. The methods that support this fluid API are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><code>{@link #setActive(boolean)}</code>: Sets the active state of 
 *     the spring and returns the updated <code>Spring</code> object.</li>
 *     <li><code>{@link #setRestLength(double)}</code>: Sets the rest length 
 *     and returns the updated <code>Spring</code> object.</li>
 *     <li><code>{@link #scaleRestLength(double)}</code>: Scales the current 
 *     rest length by a given scalar and returns the updated <code>Spring</code> object.</li>
 *     <li><code>{@link #relax()}</code>: Adjusts the rest length to the current 
 *     displacement and returns the updated <code>Spring</code> object.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The fluid API allows users to chain these method calls in a concise and readable 
 * manner, making it easy to configure or modify a <code>Spring</code> object 
 * in a single statement. For example:
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 *     spring.setActive(false)
 *           .scaleRestLength(1.5)
 *           .relax();
 * </code></pre>
