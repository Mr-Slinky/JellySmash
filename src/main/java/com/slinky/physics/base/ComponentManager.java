/**
 * Responsible for managing the storage, retrieval, and life-cycle of components
 * associated with entities within the the JellySmash physics engine.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code ComponentManager} is designed to be package-private, reinforcing
 * its exclusive use within the {@link Entity} class. This encapsulation ensures
 * that component management is tightly controlled and integrated directly with
 * the entity management system, avoiding unintended usage and maintaining the
 * integrity of the ECS architecture.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class provides a centralised mechanism to add, access, and remove
 * components tied to specific entities, enabling flexible and efficient
 * management of entity behaviour. By organising components within a nested
 * {@link Map} structure, it ensures that each entity's components are stored
 * contiguously in memory, promoting better cache coherence and optimising
 * access patterns, which is crucial for performance in computation-heavy
 * systems.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This nested map structure can be visualised as follows:
 * </p><br/>
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *     {
 *       entityID1: {
 *         ComponentType1.class: ComponentInstance1,
 *         ComponentType2.class: ComponentInstance2
 *       },
 *       entityID2: {
 *         ComponentType1.class: ComponentInstance3
 *       }
 *     }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * </p><br/>
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *     {
 *       1001: {
 *         Vector2D.class:   Vector2D(Position(10, 20)),
 *         Particle2D.class: Particle2D(Mass(5.0))
 *       },
 *       1002: {
 *         Vector2D.class: Vector2D(Position(50, 80))
 *       }
 *     }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each entity can only have a single instance of a particular component type
 * associated with it. This design enforces that for a given entity, there is
 * exactly one component of each type stored. If multiple instances of the same
 * type are needed, they have been combined into an aggregate or container
 * component that encapsulates those instances.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code ComponentManager} adheres to the principles of Data-Oriented
 * Programming (DOP), where the organisation of data is optimised for processing
 * efficiency.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code ComponentManager} provides type-safe operations using generics to
 * interact with components, ensuring that the correct types are used during the
 * addition, retrieval, and removal processes, thus reducing runtime errors and
 * improving code maintainability.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation Note:</b> The {@code ComponentManager} is intended to be
 * used exclusively by the {@link Entity} class, and its methods are accessed
 * indirectly through the {@link Entity} instances to manage their components.
 * </p>

     *
     * <p>
     * This method associates the provided component with the specified entity
     * by storing it in the {@code components} map. If the entity does not
     * already have a component map, a new one is created and associated with
     * the entity's ID. The component is then stored in this inner map, keyed by
     * its class type, allowing for efficient retrieval and management.

     * By structuring the component storage in this way, the method ensures that
     * component data is stored contiguously in memory, improving cache
     * coherence and access speed, which is critical in performance-sensitive
