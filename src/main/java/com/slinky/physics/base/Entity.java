/**
 * Represents a unique entity within the backend ECS system that is associated
 * with various {@link Component} implementations upon instantiation. The
 * creation and management of entities are handled by the {@link Entities}
 * utility class, which provides functionality for creating, retrieving, and
 * destroying entities within the system.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class maintains a reference to the {@link ComponentManager} singleton
 * instance, ensuring that all component-related operations are centralised and
 * managed efficiently. The {@code ComponentManager} is package-private, which
 * restricts its direct access to the {@code Entity} class, enforcing a tight
 * coupling between these two classes. This design ensures that component
 * management is handled exclusively through the {@code Entity} class, promoting
 * encapsulation and reducing the potential for mismanagement of components.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code ComponentManager} class provides a centralised mechanism for
 * adding, accessing, and removing components tied to specific entities. When
 * component-related methods are called on an {@code Entity}, the entity passes
 * a reference to itself to the {@code ComponentManager}, allowing components to
 * be managed in a way that appears as if each entity has its own component
 * manager. This design simplifies the interaction with components, allowing
 * them to be accessed directly from the {@code Entity} instance while
 * maintaining a clear separation of concerns between entity management and
 * component management.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By centralising entity and component management within a single
 * {@code ComponentManager} instance, this design ensures that all entities
 * share a common mechanism for managing components, optimising resource usage
 * and enhancing the performance of the system.
