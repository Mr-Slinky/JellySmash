/**
 * <p>
 * This package provides essential utility and object classes that are utilised
 * by the various systems within the Physics Entity Component System (ECS).
 * These utilities facilitate critical operations such as collision detection,
 * mathematical updates, and numerical integration for simulating real-world
 * physics behaviour.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Classes and Interfaces</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <b>CollisionPair</b> - This class represents a pair of {@link PointMass}
 * objects that are involved in a collision. It ensures that collisions are
 * treated symmetrically, meaning that the pair (first, second) is considered
 * equivalent to (second, first). The class encapsulates all logic necessary to
 * manage and process these collisions.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>IntegrationMethod</b> - This interface defines the contract for numerical
 * integration methods. These methods are responsible for updating the velocity
 * and position of particles in the physics simulation. Implementing classes
 * must provide methods that take in current particle state and time
 * information, returning updated positions and velocities based on the chosen
 * numerical scheme.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>IntegrationMethods</b> - This class provides a suite of pre-defined
 * numerical integration functions. These functions are used to approximate
 * continuous motion over discrete time steps, ensuring the simulation
 * accurately reflects the dynamics of the system. Methods provided in this
 * class include common numerical techniques such as Euler and Runge-Kutta
 * integration methods.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Overview</h2>
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package serve as foundational tools for physics-based
 * simulations. By abstracting collision management and integration methods,
 * this package allows the core physics engine to focus on higher-level
 * concerns, leaving the heavy lifting of vector calculations, time-step
 * updates, and collision symmetry to these utilities.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The primary focus of this package is to ensure that the physics simulation
 * remains both accurate and efficient, even as the complexity of the system
 * grows. These classes work together to manage the state of particles and other
 * physical objects, ensuring that movement and collisions are processed
 * correctly over each time step.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Future Development</h2>
 * <p>
 * As the physics engine evolves, this package may be expanded to include more
 * sophisticated integration methods and additional utilities for handling edge
 * cases in collisions. New methods for reducing floating-point errors and
 * optimising time-step calculations will likely be integrated to maintain the
 * precision of the simulations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The architecture of this package is flexible, allowing developers to extend
 * or modify the existing classes to suit the specific needs of their physics
 * simulations. Whether using simple particle systems or more advanced
 * multi-object interactions, the utilities provided here lay a robust
 * foundation for future growth.
