/**
 * A core component of the JellySmash physics engine, responsible for
 * calculating and applying
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics">kinematic</a> equations to
 * simulate realistic motion of entities within the game.
 *
 * <p>
 * This system primarily manages the motion of objects represented as
 * {@link PointMass} components. Upon construction, the {@code MotionSystem}
 * automatically fetches the relevant entities through the {@link Entities}
 * utility class, which are created earlier during the initialisation process.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@link #add(PointMass...)} method is available to dynamically add new
 * particles to the system. Its primary role is convenience, allowing particles
 * to be added during runtime if needed. However, the system's primary operation
 * relies on the pre-fetched entities, making it immediately ready to update the
 * physics state of these entities after construction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code MotionSystem} is integrated into the broader physics engine, and
 * its update sequence is carefully controlled by the engine's
 * {@link PhysicsEngine#update(double)} method. In this sequence, the
 * {@code MotionSystem} is invoked after force calculations are performed by
 * other systems, ensuring that all forces are correctly applied before motion
 * updates occur. This structured approach guarantees the integrity and
 * consistency of the physics simulation, preventing issues such as unstable or
 * incorrect updates.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code MotionSystem} uses an injected {@link IntegrationMethod} to
 * calculate the motion of particles. This allows the system to employ different
 * numerical integration techniques, such as Euler or Verlet, depending on the
 * needs of the simulation. This flexibility provides precise control over how
 * motion is calculated, allowing the system to adapt to various scenarios and
 * requirements within the game.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A typical usage pattern of the {@code MotionSystem} involves constructing the
 * system with a chosen {@link IntegrationMethod} and then allowing the physics
 * engine to manage its update process. The system will automatically manage the
 * motion of all relevant entities, updating their state based on the forces
 * applied during each update cycle.
 * </p>
 *

 *     MotionSystem motionSystem = new MotionSystem(IntegrationMethod.EULER);
