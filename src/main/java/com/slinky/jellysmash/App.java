/**
 * The main entry point for the JellySmash application.
 *
 * <p>
 * This method serves as the launching point for the JavaFX application by
 * calling the {@link #launch()} method, which in turn triggers the JavaFX
 * runtime to start the application and subsequently invoke the {@link #init()}
 * and {@link #start(Stage)} methods.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The `main` method is the first method called when the application starts,
 * responsible for initialising the JavaFX environment. It prepares the
 * necessary infrastructure to begin the execution of the game by delegating to
 * the {@code launch()} method, which takes care of setting up the JavaFX
 * application lifecycle.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Once the JavaFX environment is ready, the {@link #init()} method is called to
 * initialise the core components of the game, such as the
 * {@link PhysicsEngine}, {@link RenderSystem}, and {@link WorldDisplay}. These
 * components are crucial for the game's physics calculations and rendering.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link #start(Stage)} method then sets up the primary stage (window) of
 * the application, defining the main scene and displaying it on the screen. The
 * game loop, encapsulated within the {@link GameLoop} class, is started here to
 * continuously update the physics and render the game world.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This method ensures that the JellySmash game starts smoothly, handing off
 * control to the JavaFX runtime to manage the user interface, event handling,
 * and rendering loop.
