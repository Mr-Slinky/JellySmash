/**
 * The {@code GameLoop} class is responsible for managing the core loop of the
 * JellySmash game, handling the timing and update cycles necessary for
 * simulating physics and rendering the game world.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class ties together the physics engine and rendering system, ensuring
 * that the game updates at a consistent frame rate. By leveraging the
 * {@link AnimationTimer}, it efficiently manages the update-render cycle,
 * calling the {@link PhysicsEngine#update(double)} method to simulate physics
 * and the {@link WorldDisplay#drawWorld()} method to render the updated game
 * state.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code GameLoop} class is designed to be simple yet flexible, allowing
 * the game to start and stop its main loop via the {@link #start()} and
 * {@link #stop()} methods, respectively. This class encapsulates the logic
 * necessary to calculate the time elapsed between frames and use that to drive
 * the simulation, ensuring smooth and consistent gameplay.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Example Usage:</b></p>
 * <pre><code>
 * // Create a physics engine and world display
 * PhysicsEngine engine = new PhysicsEngine();
 * WorldDisplay display = new WorldDisplay(new RenderSystem(), 500, 800);
 *
 * // Create the game loop
 * GameLoop gameLoop = new GameLoop(engine, display);
 *
 * // Start the game loop
 * gameLoop.start();
 *
 * // Stop the game loop when needed
 * gameLoop.stop();
 * </code></pre>
