/**
 * The {@code MotionSystem} class is a specialised physics system within the
 * JellySmash game that handles the calculation and application of motion forces
 * on particles, particularly focusing on updating their acceleration, velocity,
 * and position. This class is a core component of the game's physics engine,
 * simulating realistic movement by integrating gravitational forces and other
 * potential forces acting on the particles.
 *
 * <p>
 * The primary responsibility of the {@code MotionSystem} is to manage the
 * motion of {@code Particle2D} components by applying the Earth's gravitational
 * force, represented by the constant {@link #GRAVITY_EARTH}, and updating their
 * positions and velocities over time. The system operates under the assumption
 * that the acceleration and velocity of particles are the final steps in their
 * state updates, meaning any external forces should be applied before invoking
 * this system to ensure accurate and realistic motion calculations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to be flexible and extendable, allowing for the
 * integration of additional forces beyond gravity by external systems or
 * classes. The class is structured to handle both static and dynamic particles,
 * with static particles being ignored in the motion calculations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * One of the key features of the {@code MotionSystem} is its reliance on an
 * {@code IntegrationMethod} for updating velocities and positions. This method
 * is injected as a dependency during the calculation process, allowing for
 * different integration techniques to be applied depending on the specific
 * needs of the simulation. For example, you can choose to use the Euler method
 * by selecting {@code IntegrationMethod integrator = IntegrationMethod.EULER;}
 * and passing this integrator to the {@link #calculateVelocitiesAndPositions}
 * method. This approach provides a high degree of flexibility and precision in
 * the way the physics system handles updates, making it adaptable to a variety
 * of scenarios within the game.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage of this system typically follows a three-step process:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Apply motion forces (e.g., gravity) using the {@link #applyMotionForces}
 * method.</li>
 * <li>Calculate accelerations based on the accumulated forces using
 * {@link #calculateAccelerations}.</li>
 * <li>Update velocities and positions using the specified
 * {@link IntegrationMethod} through
 * {@link #calculateVelocitiesAndPositions}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * This ensures a clear and consistent update sequence, crucial for maintaining
 * the integrity of the physics simulation.
 * </p>
