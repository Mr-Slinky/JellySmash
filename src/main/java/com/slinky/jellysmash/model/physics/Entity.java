/**
 * The {@code Entity} class represents a uniquely identifiable object within the
 * system. Each instance of {@code Entity} is assigned a unique identifier at
 * the time of creation, which ensures that every entity can be distinctly
 * identified and managed within the system.
 *
 * <p>
 * The unique identifier for each {@code Entity} is generated and assigned by
 * the external {@link EntityFactory} class. This design enforces the integrity
 * of the identifier, ensuring that no two entities share the same identifier.
 * The {@link EntityFactory} is solely responsible for the creation of
 * {@code Entity} instances, which promotes consistency and centralises control
 * over the entity creation process.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The constructor of the {@code Entity} class is deliberately made
 * package-private, restricting direct instantiation by other classes. This
 * design choice ensures that entities can only be created through the
 * {@link EntityFactory}, further enforcing the uniqueness and integrity of the
 * entity identifiers.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is a core component of the system's architecture, as it provides
 * the foundational building block for entities managed by the system. Entities
 * created using this class are typically managed by the {@link EntityFactory},
 * which handles the lifecycle, storage, and retrieval of entities.
