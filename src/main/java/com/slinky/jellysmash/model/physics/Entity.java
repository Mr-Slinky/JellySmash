/**
 * The {@code Entity} class represents a uniquely identifiable entity within the system.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each instance of {@code Entity} is assigned a unique identifier upon creation. 
 * The unique identifier is managed through a static counter, ensuring that 
 * each entity is distinctly identifiable. This class is particularly useful in 
 * scenarios where entities need to be tracked or managed uniquely within a 
 * system, such as in games, simulations, or data management contexts.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The class leverages the Java record feature, which is a compact and immutable 
 * data structure, making it an ideal choice for representing simple entities 
 * with only an identifier.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class provides a constructor for creating an entity with a specified 
 * identifier, and it maintains a static counter to keep track of the number of 
 * entities created. Additionally, it provides a static method to retrieve the 
 * current count of entities, which can be useful for various tracking or 
 * debugging purposes.
