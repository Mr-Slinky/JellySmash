/**
 * The {@code Particle2D} class provides a concrete implementation of the
 * {@link Particle} interface, representing a 2-dimensional particle in a
 * physics simulation.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class encapsulates the core physical properties of a particle, including
 * its mass, damping coefficient, restitution, position, velocity, acceleration,
 * and whether it is static. These properties are crucial for simulating
 * realistic physical behaviours, such as motion, collisions, and force
 * interactions, within a 2D space.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code Particle2D} class is designed to be flexible and extensible,
 * allowing it to be used in various types of physics simulations, from simple
 * point masses to more complex physical objects. The class ensures that all
 * physical properties are initialised with valid, non-negative values, throwing
 * an exception if any invalid values are provided.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is essential for developers implementing a 2D physics engine using
 * the Entity Component System (ECS) pattern, as it provides the basic building
 * blocks for creating and manipulating physical entities within the simulation.
 * By adhering to the {@link Particle} interface, {@code Particle2D} ensures
 * compatibility and interoperability with other components and systems within
 * the ECS framework.

     * particle responds to forces. A greater mass results in greater inertia,
     * meaning the particle will be less affected by applied forces. The mass
     * must be a non-negative value, and it is validated upon initialisation to
     * ensure that it conforms to this requirement.

     * The damping coefficient of the particle, controlling the rate at which
     * its motion decreases over time.

     * Damping simulates the effects of friction or resistance, gradually
     * reducing the particle's velocity and bringing it to rest. A higher
     * damping coefficient results in faster decay of motion. This value must be
     * non-negative and is validated during initialisation.

     * Restitution affects how the particle behaves upon impact with other
     * objects. A value of 1.0 indicates a perfectly elastic collision where no
     * energy is lost, while a value of 0 means the particle does not bounce and
     * all energy is absorbed. This value must be non-negative and is checked
