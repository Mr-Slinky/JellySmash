/**
 * The {@code EntityFactory} class is responsible for managing the life cycle of
 * entities within an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. It provides
 * functionality for creating, retrieving, and destroying entities, as well as
 * managing their associated components through integration with a
 * {@link ComponentManager}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code EntityFactory} ensures that each entity is assigned a unique
 * identifier in a thread-safe manner using an {@link AtomicLong} for ID
 * generation. Entities are stored in an internal map, which allows for
 * efficient retrieval and management of entities within the system.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class also includes methods for creating specific types of entities,
 * such as points and vectors, with corresponding components like
 * {@link Vector2D}. By delegating component management to the
 * {@code ComponentManager}, the {@code EntityFactory} maintains a clear
 * separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and extend the ECS.
