/**
 * The {@code EntityType} enum represents the various types of entities that can
 * exist within the physics system of the Jelly Smash game. Each entity type has
 * distinct characteristics and behaviors that influence how it interacts with
 * other entities and the game environment.
 *
 * <p>
 * The entities defined here are fundamental components within the physics
 * simulation, providing the basis for more complex structures and interactions.
 * This enum may be extended in the future to include additional entity types as
 * the physics system evolves.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example usage:</p>
 * <pre><code>
 *     void someLogicOnEntities(EntityType e) {
 *         switch (e) {
 *             case POINT:
 *                 // Handle point entity logic
 *                 break;
 *             case VECTOR:
 *                 // Handle vector entity logic
 *                 break;
 *             case PARTICLE:
 *                 // Handle particle entity logic
 *                 break;
 *             default:
 *                 throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Unknown entity type: " + entityType);
 *         }
 *     }
