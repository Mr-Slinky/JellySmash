/**
 * The {@code IntegrationMethods} class provides a collection of numerical
 * integration functions for use in physics simulations. These methods update
 * the state of vectors and positions based on discrete time steps, enabling the
 * approximation of continuous motion within the simulation.
 *
 * <p>
 * All methods in this class operate by directly modifying the values of the
 * first argument passed to the function and returning the modified object. This
 * design ensures that no new vector instances are created during the operation,
 * making the methods efficient for use in high-performance simulations where
 * minimizing object creation is crucial.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The class also encapsulates constants representing specific integration
 * methods. Each constant is implemented as a private static class that adheres
 * to the {@link IntegrationMethod} interface, ensuring a consistent API for
 * integration across the simulation framework.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Currently, the class provides a single integration method, {@code EULER},
 * which implements the Euler method of integration. This method updates
 * velocity and position by calculating and using the average velocity over a
 * time step, providing a straightforward and commonly used approach to
 * numerical integration in physics simulations.
 * </p>
