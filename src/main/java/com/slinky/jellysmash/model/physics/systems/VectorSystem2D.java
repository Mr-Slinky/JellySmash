 * The {@code VectorSystem2D} abstract class provides a foundational framework

 * <p>
 * This class offers a comprehensive set of vector operations, including
 * addition, scaling, normalisation, dot product, cross product, and more. These
 * operations are essential for manipulating vectors in physics simulations,
 * computer graphics, and other applications that require precise control over
 * 2D vector data. The class ensures that vector operations are performed safely
 * and consistently by checking type compatibility between vectors before
 * executing operations, throwing an {@link IllegalArgumentException} in case of
 * a mismatch.
