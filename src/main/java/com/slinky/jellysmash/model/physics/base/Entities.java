/**
 * A utility class responsible for managing the life cycle of entities within
 * the ECS architecture. It provides functionality for creating, retrieving, and
 * destroying entities.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code Entities} ensures that each entity is assigned a unique identifier
 * in a thread-safe manner using an {@link AtomicLong} for ID generation.
 * Entities are stored in an internal map, which allows for efficient retrieval
 * and management of entities within the system.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class also includes methods for creating specific types of entities,
 * such as points and vectors, with corresponding components like
 * {@link Vector2D}. By delegating component management to the
 * {@code ComponentManager}, the {@code Entities} maintains a clear separation
 * of concerns, making it easier to manage and extend the ECS.
